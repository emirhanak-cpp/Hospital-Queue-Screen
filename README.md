# Hospital-Queue-Screen
An application that can be used in hospitals for patients to track their queue to see the doctor they are appointed to.
In this directory I'm including .py files for the screens of the doctor, the patient, and the queue screen that is going to be displayed at the top of the doctor's office. The .ui files that are also included are the interfaces of the different windows just mentioned.
This project uses MySQL server algorithms to store and access data of patients. The patient can use the patient screen application to enter their information and the doctor will be able to see it on their screen.
